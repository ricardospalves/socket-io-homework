# Socket.io Homework

🚧 Work in progress 🚧.

This is my solution to [Socket.io's homework](https://socket.io/get-started/chat#homework).

## Todo list

- [ ] Create a basic chat application;
- [ ] Broadcast a message to connected users when someone connects or disconnects;
- [ ] Add support for nicknames;
- [ ] Don’t send the same message to the user that sent it. Instead, append the message directly as soon as they press enter;
- [ ] Add “{user} is typing” functionality;
- [ ] Show who’s online;
- [ ] Add private messaging.
