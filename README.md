# Socket.io Homework

This is my solution to [Socket.io's homework](https://socket.io/get-started/chat#homework).

## Todo list

- [x] Create a basic chat application;
- [x] Broadcast a message to connected users when someone connects or disconnects;
- [x] Add support for nicknames;
- [x] Don’t send the same message to the user that sent it. Instead, append the message directly as soon as they press enter;
- [x] Add “{user} is typing” functionality;
- [x] Show who’s online;
- [x] Add private messaging.
